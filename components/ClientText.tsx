          &quot;We have been working with Proone Labs for about a year on our preclinical PK studies.  The Proone Labs scientists are knowledgeable and readily available for discussions.  We hired Proone Labs to develop a method to characterize blood levels of our compound. Through Proone Labs diligence, we discovered that the standard LCMS method would not work for our compound and Proone Labs helped in that and developed the method that we used throughout our development.&quot;
